2. **Liver & Kidney Panel**:
   - Creatinine levels and estimated GFR are normal, indicating good kidney function.
   - Liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) are within the reference range, suggesting normal liver function.
   - Urea, uric acid, and bilirubin levels are normal.

3. **Lipid Screen**:
   - Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and VLDL levels are in the optimal range.
   - Non-HDL cholesterol is within the recommended levels.
   - Triglycerides are within the healthy range.

4. **HbA1c**:
   - HbA1c levels are in the healthy range, indicating well-controlled blood sugar levels.
   - Average glucose levels are normal.

5. **Glucose Fasting**:
   - Fasting glucose levels are normal, suggesting good blood sugar control.

6. **Thyroid Profile**:
   - T3, T4, and TSH levels are within the normal reference range, indicating normal thyroid function.

7. **Vitamin B12**:
