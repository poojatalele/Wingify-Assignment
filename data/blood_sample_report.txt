Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk factors especially lipid profile. This should be 
done earlier if there is family history of premature heart disease, dyslipidemia, obesity or other risk 
factors
4.Indians tend to have higher triglyceride levels & Lower HDL cholesterol combined with small dense 
LDL particles, a pattern known as atherogenic dyslipidemia
5.Non HDL Cholesterol comprises the cholesterol carried by all atherogenic particles, including LDL, IDL, 
VLDL & VLDL remnants, Chylomicron remnants & Lp(a)
6.LAI recommends LDL cholesterol as primary target and Non HDL cholesterol as co-primary treatment 
target
7.Apolipoprotein B is an, secondary lipid target for treatment once LDL & Non HDL goals have been 
achieved
8.Additional testing for Apolipoprotein B, hsCRP, Lp(a ) & LP-PLA2  should be considered among 
patients with moderate risk for ASCVD for risk refinement

1.TSH levels are subject to circadian variation, reaching peak levels between 2 - 4.a.m. and at a 
minimum between 6-10 pm . The variation is of the order of 50% .  hence time of the day has 
influence on the measured serum TSH concentrations.
2.Alteration in concentration of Thyroid hormone binding protein can profoundly affect Total T3 and/or 
Total T4 levels especially in pregnancy and in patients on steroid therapy.
3.Unbound fraction ( Free,T4 /Free,T3) of thyroid hormone is biologically active form and correlate 
more closely with clinical status of the patient than total T4/T3 concentration
4.Values <0.03 uIU/mL need to be clinically correlated due to presence of a rare TSH   variant in

1.Interpretation of the result should be considered in relation to clinical circumstances.
2.It is recommended to consider supplementary testing with plasma Methylmalonic acid (MMA) or 
plasma homocysteine levels to determine biochemical cobalamin deficiency in presence of clinical 
suspicion of deficiency but indeterminate levels. Homocysteine levels are more sensitive but MMA is 
more specific
3.False increase in Vitamin B12 levels may be observed in patients with intrinsic factor blocking 
antibodies, MMA measurement should be considered in such patients

·It shows seasonal variation, with values being 40-50% lower in winter than in summer. 
·Levels vary with age and are increased in pregnancy. 
·A new test Vitamin D, Ultrasensitive by LC-MS/MS is also available
Comments
Vitamin D promotes absorption of calcium and phosphorus and mineralization of bones and teeth. Deficiency 
in children causes Rickets and in adults leads to Osteomalacia.  It can also lead to Hypocalcemia and 
Tetany.  Vitamin D status is best determined  by measurement of 25 hydroxy vitamin D, as it is the major 
circulating form and has longer half life (2-3 weeks) than 1,25 Dihydroxy vitamin D (5-8 hrs).
Decreased Levels
·Inadequate exposure to sunlight
·Dietary deficiency
·Vitamin D malabsorption
·Severe  Hepatocellular disease
·Drugs like Anticonvulsants
·Nephrotic syndrome
